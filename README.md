RubyAudioMetadata
=================

Simple script to set audio metadata based on folder structure

It recieves a list of paths as arguments and for each of them it changes metadata on audio files based on the following structure.

folder/[title]
folder/[artist]/[title]
folder/[artist]/[album]/[title]

If future versions it could be possible to make the script accept options to define your own structure of files and order of tags
